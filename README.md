This app is a light spin-off of the [Terribly Dank Tales](https://www.facebook.com/terriblydanktalestdt/), but in mobile version,
and also the 1st app that led to the starting of my Android Career.

Enough about me, what **The Story Writer** can do:

* Create your own short stories from the pre-defined templates and make memes or speak your heart out, and finally save it!
